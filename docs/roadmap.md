## Technical Debt & Infrastructure

| Item | Priority | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Expand Playwright suite with import-then-search flow | medium | Needs DB isolation per test |
| Add Playwright tests for Performance mode setlist nav | medium | Phase 2 feature |
| Review chordsheetjs version for paragraph separation fix | low | Named sections currently merge into one `.paragraph` |

---

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-03-29 | Renderer font: Barlow Condensed | Narrower letterforms → more lyrics per line on tablet |
| 2026-03-29 | Chord color: #fde68a (light yellow) | High contrast on dark stage backgrounds vs prior amber |
| 2026-03-29 | Section labels: JS DOM injection [A][B][C] | Musician convention for rehearsal ("go to letter B") |
| 2026-03-29 | Chorus bar: JS DOM post-process in SongRenderer | chordsheetjs doesn't add `.chorus` class on named sections |
| 2026-03-29 | Key/tempo from `song.transcription`, not renderer | chordsheetjs HtmlDivFormatter strips all metadata directives |
| 2026-03-30 | Section badges: graphical bordered box with repeat superscript | Matches chords.wiki convention; repeated sections (A, B, B², C) instantly recognizable on stage |
| 2026-03-30 | Horizontal page-flip for multi-column | Eliminates accidental scroll; pedal always advances exactly one column |
| 2026-03-31 | Teams scoped to Phase 3 alongside Firestore sync | Teams require per-user cloud identity; natural prerequisite chain |
| 2026-04-01 | Sync manual-only via SyncContext + firestoreSync.ts | Stage safety guaranteed by absence of sync calls in PerformancePage |
| 2026-04-01 | Team invite check queries all Firestore /teams docs | Simple approach; revisit with inviteIndex if team count grows |
| 2026-04-01 | Team books use `Book.sharedTeamId` in same Dexie table | Avoids separate team song table; role enforcement at read/write layer |
| 2026-04-04 | `.column` uses `white-space: pre-wrap` not `pre` | `pre` prevented word-wrap; long lines overflowed column width on narrow screens |
| 2026-04-04 | `.row { break-inside: avoid }` | Prevents CSS column break from orphaning a chord above its lyric |
| 2026-04-04 | Arrow key nav in ViewerPage (not just PerformancePage) | Users navigate with pedal in non-fullscreen viewer |
| 2026-04-04 | Setlist boundary feedback via toast | Disabled buttons gave no explanation; toast communicates the boundary |
| 2026-04-04 | `onSnapshot` in TeamDetailPage for real-time invite sync | Owner's Dexie stays stale after invitee accepts on their device |
| 2026-04-04 | Bulk song sharing via select-mode in LibraryPage | One-by-one share too slow for 50+ songs; select-mode enables `bulkAdd` + `bulkMove` |
| 2026-04-04 | Key badge opens 12-key transpose picker with chord previews | Jump to target key directly without stepping through semitones |
| 2026-04-05 | CCLI/copyright/URL stored as ChordPro directives, not Song fields | Consistent with existing metadata pattern; no schema migration; content is the source of truth |
| 2026-04-05 | Cloud update poll uses 3-read `where('updatedAt', '>', lastSync)` check | Lightweight — 3 Firestore reads per 5-min interval; does not pull data until user triggers Sync Now |
| 2026-04-05 | OpenSong inline metadata extracted before lyrics conversion | Many files omit XML key/tempo tags and embed them as the first "chord line"; extract once and skip during rendering pass |
| 2026-04-05 | Duplicate resolution is batch-level (skip all / overwrite all) | Per-song choice creates too much friction for 100+ file imports; batch decision covers most real-world scenarios |
| 2026-04-05 | Non-chord chord-position text → `.chord-annotation` (italic/muted) | Keeps the ChordPro content unchanged; renderer detects and re-styles non-chord tokens post-render |
| 2026-04-05 | Editor extra metadata rows collapsed by default | Keeps the editor clean for everyday editing; amber dot signals when attribution fields hold data |
