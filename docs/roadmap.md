## Phase 3 — Collaboration · *future*

Focus: Firestore sync, teams, shared song/setlist spaces, edit presence.

### Sync & Auth

| Item | Req IDs | Priority |
|------|---------|----------|
| Firestore manual sync with last-write-wins | SYNC-01–02 | critical |
| Sync status badge (🟢🟡🔴✈️) | SYNC-03 | high |
| Edit presence banner ("⚠ Lisa is editing") | SYNC-04 | high |
| Stage safety: present mode disables all sync | SYNC-05 | high |

### Teams & shared spaces

| Item | Req IDs | Priority |
|------|---------|----------|
| Team creation and management (name, description) | TEAMS-01 | critical |
| Invite members by Google email; accept/decline flow | TEAMS-04 | critical |
| Role system: Owner / Contributor / Reader | TEAMS-03, 08–10 | critical |
| Remove members; change roles (Owner only) | TEAMS-04 | high |
| Team shared song library — scoped queries in Dexie + Firestore | TEAMS-02, 05 | high |
| Team shared setlists | TEAMS-02, 05 | high |
| Copy song to another book or team space | TEAMS-06 | medium |

### Other

| Item | Req IDs | Priority |
|------|---------|----------|
| ZIP bulk export | — | low |
| Share-link for single song snapshot | — | low |

## Phase 4 — Polish · *deferred*

| Item | Req IDs | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Viewer role (read-only teammates) | — | |
| Published / locked books and setlists | — | |
| Setlist duplication for recurring services | SET-12 | |
| Additional UI languages (beyond EN/DE) | — | |
| Chord diagram rendering for `{chord:}` / `{define:}` | — | Out of scope per spec |

---

## Technical Debt & Infrastructure

| Item | Priority | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Add `public/icons/icon-192.png` + `icon-512.png` | high | Placeholder SVG renders to PNG |
| Expand Playwright suite with import-then-search flow | medium | Needs DB isolation per test |
| Add Playwright tests for Performance mode setlist nav | medium | Phase 2 feature |
| Review chordsheetjs version for paragraph separation fix | low | Named sections currently merge into one `.paragraph` |

---

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-03-29 | Renderer font: Barlow Condensed | Narrower letterforms → more lyrics per line on tablet |
| 2026-03-29 | Chord color: #fde68a (light yellow) | High contrast on dark stage backgrounds vs prior amber |
| 2026-03-29 | Section labels: CSS counter [A][B][C] | Musician convention for rehearsal ("go to letter B") |
| 2026-03-29 | Chorus bar: JS DOM post-process in SongRenderer | chordsheetjs doesn't add `.chorus` class on named sections |
| 2026-03-29 | Key/tempo: from `song.transcription`, not renderer | chordsheetjs HtmlDivFormatter strips all metadata directives |
| 2026-03-30 | Section badges: graphical bordered box with repeat superscript | Matches chords.wiki convention; makes repeated sections (A, B, B², C) instantly recognizable on stage |
| 2026-03-30 | Horizontal page-flip for multi-column | Eliminates accidental scroll; pedal/tap always advances exactly one column at a time |
| 2026-03-31 | Teams scoped to Phase 3 alongside Firestore sync | Teams require per-user cloud identity; building on top of Firebase Auth makes natural prerequisite chain |
